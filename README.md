# 🚀 Full Stack Application Deployment on AWS EKS using Terraform

> 👨‍💻 **A production-grade deployment architecture** for a full-stack app using AWS EKS and Terraform. Designed with scalability, security, monitoring, and automation at its core — perfect for Implementation Engineers & DevOps enthusiasts.

---

## 📌 Project Goals

✅ **High Availability & Scalability** – Multi-AZ EKS deployment with auto-scaling  
✅ **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** – Terraform modules for VPC, EKS, RDS, IAM  
✅ **Full Stack Kubernetes Deployment** – React frontend + API backend on EKS  
✅ **Logging & Monitoring** – CloudWatch, HPA   
✅ **Security** – IAM Roles, VPC security,
